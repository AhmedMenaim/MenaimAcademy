## Swift Course 

In this course I will include all you need to know about Swift as a programming language or even as a beginner in the programming, so if you don't know anything about programming, Don't worry because this course is for you üòâ

### Course Requirements
Don't worry no need for MacBook üíª you can use any PC or Laptop you have becasue we can use these online websites to help us through our journey in this course:

1. [swiftfiddle](https://swiftfiddle.com/)
2. [Online Swift Playground](http://online.swiftplayground.run/)

Also if you have a macbook Pro or Air it will be great because it will be a little bit easier to find an error or warning and if you don't know what are these warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è or errors ‚ùå , Don't worry every thing will be a piece of cake after the course.
So if you have a **macbook** you need to download [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) as we will use its **Playground** in most of our work in this course.
