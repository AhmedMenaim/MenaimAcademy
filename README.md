In this playlist I'm giving you a small introduction about the meaning of programming, its tracks, how can you find the most suitable track for you and also how to start learning it and these are the videos related to this playlist:

1. [The meaning of programming and programming languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_BmXccPlbE&list=PLcqMcXfu9uXMYUrHtlNfb0VSzAhgfp1Sz&index=1&t=4s)

## Swift Course 

In this course I will include all you need to know about Swift as a programming language or even as a beginner in the programming, so if you don't know anything about programming, Don't worry because this course is for you üòâ

### Course Requirements
Don't worry no need for MacBook üíª you can use any PC or Laptop you have becasue we can use these online websites to help us through our journey in this course:

1. [swiftfiddle](https://swiftfiddle.com/)
2. [Online Swift Playground](http://online.swiftplayground.run/)

Also if you have a macbook Pro or Air it will be great because it will be a little bit easier to find an error or warning and if you don't know what are these warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è or errors ‚ùå , Don't worry every thing will be a piece of cake after the course.
So if you have a **macbook** you need to download [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) as we will use its **Playground** in most of our work in this course.

## How to get a job

Hmmm, I'm always searching for jobs but nothing happened, I'm applying to many jobs but no one is answering me, sometimes if you don't have a response from a company the first thing came to our mind is that the company doesn't care and of course it's a bad attitude from the company and all of us knew that but we need to give 5% of this to be on us...
May be there is an issue in the CV or my Linkedin profile and that's why I have created couple of videos to show you how to enhance your Cv, LinkedIn, etc...
1. The first thing you need to know is [how you can get a job after the graduation directly](https://youtu.be/7GGG3PaNzR8) and this by pushing yourself to the limits:
   1.1 Studying hard in the college
   1.2 Try to have at least 1 internship in the college period
   1.3 Creating many projects 
   1.4 Enhancing Github, LinkedIn & CV for sure 
  
2. Of course to be able to enhance CV there are some tips you need to be able to [have a great professional CV:](https://youtu.be/NR7bAMxhqB0)

   2.1 The email should be professional (ahmedmenaim@gmail.com, mohamedahmed@outlook.com, mahmoudelshahawy47@gmail.com, etc...) so the email may include some numbers but always needs your name to be more professional & never do anything like: (mohameddarknight@gmail.com, karemdracula@outlook.com, etc...) so never put nicknames or fake names in the email because once you do that, you'll be REJECTED ‚ùå‚ùå
   
   2.2 Try to be short as possible, I don't need to check a CV includes **12** pages to be able to check if I will hire you or not so make it simple as much as you can (** PREFERED: 1 page CV **)
  
   2.3 NEVER forget to set your phone number to be able to contact you
   
   2.4 Name your CV, Of course I won't force myself to care about file in my laptop just called CV.pdf but I'll for sure care for a file called AhmedMenaim-iOS-CV.pdf , a file name which indicates to specific name, job & file type

[Sure we can face to many mistakes and obstacles especially in CV that may cause the rejection, that's why you can check this video to be able to know more
](https://youtu.be/BbyvxtGiENU)

3. Linkedin profile is a great thing for everyone searching for a job especially if you are a junior or a fresh graduate, you can trust these words from someone whose all job offers are from [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-menaim-22cm/) üòÖ So if you don't know the meaning of Linkedin or how to use it or how to create an account, I think you need to check [all you need to know about LinkedIn video](https://youtu.be/CjECJHu-4ys) (IN ARABIC)

4. Everyone needs to have a remote job when you are at your home and can reduce more time to do extra things and once you have read more about Linkedin you will knew that you can find a remote job through it by doing some steps and activates some alerts [so you can check this video which talks about how to find remote jobs using linkedin](https://youtu.be/yvkB40z32q4)

5. Have you found a remote job? Great !! but let's deep dive into the details of the contract and some issues you may face like your insurance, vaccactions, Annual balance, etc... So before signing the contract you need to know more & more about these details which you can find from here: [All you need to know about applying for a remote job.](https://youtu.be/3KQ2lEvZF5I)
